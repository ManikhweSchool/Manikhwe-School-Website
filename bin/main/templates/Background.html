                        better understanding of each other. My full name is <em>Lwandile Ganyile</em> with an original home in 
                        <strong>South Africa </strong> by the province called <strong>Eastern Cape</strong> in a midium

                        dad and <a th:href = "@{/images/Mom.jpg}" target = "frame_one">mom</a> were born. They grew up 
                        there unfortunately they didn't have a chance to get education as we did me and my <a th:href = "@{/images/Busiswa.jpg}"

                        My father told me his father was only concern about the well being of cows, nothing else. And 
                        he wanted him to be the same. He didn't care  whether or not dad went to school, what he had for lunch at 
                        school, apparently he didn't care about school at all.Things were bad in a way that my dad and his siblings 
                        would literally go to school with only a t-shirt and a short trauser as a school uniform, no shoes, no 
                        socks, no stationary either.  That is why he always inspired me to do well at school, not because he wanted 
                        me to have too much money, rather to bring value to other people by giving them a chance he never had for education. 
                        That is what this website and it's learning channel is all about, making a world a better place.

						Lucky for me they were able to take us to Durban when we were still little kids with my sister. My father 
						came to Durban looking for a job, we ended up staying there, by the township called Mayville Cato Crest which is a 
						horrible place by the way. I grew up there, went to high school named <a 
						th:href = "@{/Mayville Secondary One.jpg}" target = "frame_two">
						Mayville Secondary School</a>. Afterwards, I went to tertiary at <a href = "http : // www.ukzn.com"
						target = "frame_two">
						University of Kwa Zulu Natal</a> (Westville Campus) where I graduated with a <abbr title = "Bachelor of Science">Bsc</abbr> Computer 
                        Science, Mathematics &amp; IT degree. One may ask, then what happened? Well, after that I started working as a software developer 
                        free-lance for five years. Finally I've decided to bring my knowledge and experience to other people not for money, rather to bring 
                        value to them as it is my passion.
